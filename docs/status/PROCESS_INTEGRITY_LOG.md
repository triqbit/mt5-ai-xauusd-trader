# Process Integrity Log

This log tracks the health and safety of the autonomous workflow for the `mt5-ai-xauusd-trader` repository.

## 2026-04-30 13:37 UTC

**Summary:** Process invariants are holding on `main`, but high turbulence observed in feature branches.

**Suspected Process Issues:**
- **High Branch Turbulence:** Over 100 active feature branches exist in the repository (`remotes/origin/feature/*`, `remotes/origin/jules*`, etc.).
- **Integration Stagnation:** No new commits have been merged to `main` since the initial grafted commit `25545f5` on 2026-04-28.

**PRs/Commits Involved:**
- `main` branch: Last commit `25545f5` (2026-04-28).
- Multiple active feature branches (e.g., `origin/feature/trade-logging-system-15950882412153941868`, `origin/jules05-daily-report-2026-04-29-13696526539320925324`).

**Check Invariants:**
- [x] Changes go through PRs (No direct commits to `main` since `25545f5`).
- [x] CI must pass before merge (N/A - no merges).
- [x] Risky domains are not being changed casually (Holding on `main`).

**Recommended Follow-ups:**
- **Jules05/Human Review:** See detailed [PR Triage Dashboard](PR_TRIAGE_DAILY.md) for branch cluster analysis.
- **Consolidation:** Standardize on "Gold Standard" branches for Trade Logging (`15950882412153941868`) and Execution Filters (`6034298635007629286`).
- **Escalation:** **HIGH PRIORITY** — Jules05 must address the "Integration Stagnation" on `main` to prevent unmanageable merge conflicts.

**Status:** GREEN (Invariants holding) / 🔴 RED (Workflow turbulence - Integration Stagnation).
